# Welcome

Dear Qurit Team Member!\
We are so excited to welcome you to Team Qurit (pronounced Cure-It!).
This document is designed to give you an introduction to our goals and
visions, the various scientific efforts led by our lab, as well as make
you aware of the different resources available to you. We are thrilled
to have you with us on this exciting journey that encompasses learning,
researching, interacting, and ultimately making an impact in a
world-wide effort to help cure cancer. Let's Qurit!

# An introduction to our lab

Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, and a very significant
fraction of the population will develop cancer during their lifetime.
Here at the Quantitative Radiomolecular Imaging and Therapy (Qurit) lab
and program, we aim to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and
offer novel radiotherapy alternatives that can help save lives. We do
this by quantifying how radiopharmaceuticals - combinations of drugs and
radioactive isotopes - precisely target cancer cells, in both imaging
and therapy application.\
We are a multicultural team of scientists, researchers, and programmers
from disciplines such as physics, biomedical engineering and computer
science. Our lab is a part of the Department of Integrative Oncology at
the BC Cancer Research Institute (BCCRI), Vancouver. At Qurit, we
benefit from an culture of interdisciplinary research, owing to our
close connections with the clinical environment and our various
collaboration with researchers from other disciplines based in UBC, BC
Cancer, SFU, and even internationally, given our multiple committed
collaborators in the USA, Europe (Denmark, France, and Switzerland). We
also benefit from our collaborations with industrial partners, such as
General Electric, Siemens, Microsoft, and MIM. This gives our team
members the opportunity to gain skills that are valuable for the
translation of our developed methods to routine clinical practice.

## Our Goals and Visions

In Qurit, we aim to provide a training and mentoring environment to help
discover the true potential within each of our members. We strive to
help our members reach their very best and to become the next generation
of global experts. Our research emphasizes the following four
dimensions:

1.  Innovation: We pursue research that is innovative, rigorous, and
    meaningful.

2.  Communication: We prioritize active communication of our research in
    scientific conferences and via publication of our work as
    peer-reviewed journal articles.

3.  Collaboration: We emphasize collaborations, including support of
    world-class physicians and scientists, to define the future of
    nuclear medicine imaging & therapy.

4.  Translation: We aim for the translation of our methods to
    state-of-the-art patient care and to impact quality of life

Our principle core values include: (i) Integrity, (ii) Circle of safety
& trust, (iii) Openness & curiosity, (iv) Optimism & perseverance, (v)
Creativity, (vi) Teamwork, and (vii) Scientific excellence.\
We pursue interdisciplinary research towards enhanced quantitative
nuclear medicine (radiomolecular) imaging (PET & SPECT). Coupled with
our provincial functional imaging and therapy program, we emphasize
partnerships with other collaborators, clinical sites and industry,
aiming to translate our image generation and analysis methods (including
artificial intelligence) to state-of-the-art patient care and to impact
quality of life. Our efforts include:

-   Quantitative PET imaging methods for enhanced diagnosis, prognosis
    and treatment response assessment of cancer patients (e.g. prostrate
    cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, etc.)

-   Quantitative SPECT-based dosimetry in molecular radiotherapy of
    cancer patients (also known as radionuclide, radioligand or
    radiopharmaceutical therapy)

-   Radiomics and machine learning methods as applied to PET and SPECT
    imaging of cancer

-   Tumor growth modeling and linkage with imaging features (radiomics)

-   Building of digital twins for our cancer patients towards improved
    personalized healthcare planning and delivery

-   Anthropomorphic phantom studies

-   Optimization of clinical PET & SPECT imaging protocols

-   Development of routine clinical workflows involving advanced imaging
    (including AI based methods)

-   Dynamic whole-body PET/CT imaging

-   Statistical image reconstruction algorithms

-   and more!

## Qurit weekly meetings

Want to know more about the specifics of the research done by each
member of Qurit? One of the best ways to learn more is to join our
hybrid Qurit weekly meetings, either in-person or on zoom
(<https://ubc.zoom.us/j/7491992349>, password: 123456). These weekly
meetings are attended by all the members of the lab and are *usually*
used for broad discussion of research being conducted by different
members of the group. We follow a rotation model for these meetings,
i.e., each week a different pre-assigned member leads the meeting and
presents their work. These meetings often lead to interesting
discussions/suggestions.

# Qurit clusters

As is evident from the previous section, the research at the Qurit lab
involves a multitude of different areas in the broad field of the
science and engineering of nuclear medicine. As a result, to understand
our efforts better, the group can be divided into various sub-groups
(termed as "clusters") each with their own set of objectives and goals,
tackling a different real-world problem in nuclear medicine research.
The various Qurit clusters, their research goals, cluster leads and
members, and weekly meeting links are given in Table below. Apart from
the weekly Qurit meeting (which is attended by all the Qurit members),
each of the clusters hold their own (biweekly) meetings. These meetings
are used for getting updates on everyone's progress in the previous two
weeks, and for brainstorming innovative ideas. Feel free to drop by any
of the meetings of any of these clusters (even if you are not a
dedicated member of that cluster). These meetings are also hybrid, i.e.,
held simultaneously in-person (Dorothy Lam meeting room: 1st floor,
BCCRI) and on the zoom link (<https://ubc.zoom.us/j/7491992349>,
password: 123456). Check out the Qurit calendar for an updated schedule
for these meetings on the link: [Qurit

| Comp Sci & Translational Tools                 |       Here, we strive to develop generalized open-source softwares to facilitate medical imaging data analysis  transfer, machine learning and AI, that helps researchers send/receive data to applications of their choice, or even to partner research labs at ease. Take a look at the applications we've developed on the Qurit \href{https://github.com/qurit}{Github}.    | Carlos |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
| Lymphoma                  | Here, we aim to develop and validate the fully automated detection and segmentation methods based on AI techniques (including supervised, semi-supervised an unsupervised approaches) for lesion segmentation in the PET/CT imaging of different types of lymphoma.  We consider the generalizability of the suggested models on multicenter scans and also explore new predictive features and biomarkers by investigating “new radiomics” analysis for outcome prediction in lymphoma patients.                                                          | Fereshteh                                                                                                  |
| Prostrate                 | Here, we develop computational methods and analysis approaches for quantitative PET/CT images acquired with PSMA tracers. Our specific focus is on the automatic detection and segmentation of prostate cancer lesions. The cluster also includes research on personalized dosimetry in treatment of prostate cancer, and outcome prediction after different therapy types.                                                                                                                                                                                | Amirhossein                                                                                                |
| Dosimetry                 | Here, we aim to improve all required steps within the dosimetry workflow. Starting with quantitative activity measurements, which can be obtained via PET/SPECT imaging, we also continuously challenge ourselves on how to register multi-modality and multi-time point images. We further investigate the time-activity-curve (TAC) fitting and how to move towards single-time point dosimetry. Lastly, we compare different absorbed dose calculation methods as well as more complex dosimetry approaches for organs at risk such as the bone marrow. | Carlos                                                                                                     |
| Pharmacokinetic modelling | Here, we aim to obtain better understanding of the basic concepts of physiologically-based pharmacokinetics as well as gain insights into recent developments in the field. In our vivid discussions, we continuously learn from each other and aim to find new approaches for our research, often by inviting expert guest speakers in our hybrid (bi)weekly meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Julia                                                                                                      |

# Tutorials

One of our missions at Qurit is to provide a conducive training and
mentoring environment to help each member discover their true potential
and reach their very best and become next generation of global experts.
As a result, we have made a list of various introductory resources for
the incoming members which might help them learn the tools necessary to
conduct effective research in our lab. Remember to treat these as only
starting points which will help you get a basic understanding of these
topics as you explore more advanced articles/resources going forward. As
you go through these resources, do not hesitate to discuss your
learning/questions with other, more experienced members of the lab.

## UBC PHYS 541 (Nuclear Medicine course)

This is a graduate-level medical physics course at UBC jointly offered
by Dr. Arman Rahmim and Dr. Carlos Uribe, once in two years. The
relevant textbook for this course is [*Nuclear Medicine Physics: The
Basics, 8$^{th}$
edition*](https://www.amazon.ca/Nuclear-Medicine-Physics-Ramesh-Chandra/dp/149638184X)
by Chandra and Rahmim. Owing to the COVID lockdown, this course was
offered online on Zoom for the term Jan-Apr 2021, and as a result, the
entire course content was recorded and is being posted on our Qurit
YouTube channel (more videos to follow). Check out our *Qurit Research &
Education* channel on YouTube here:\
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWF6tnHCSXhqXZEker0eXA>.\
If we could suggest a single tutorial for hands-on learning about
medical image analysis, we would strongly recommend taking the two
"Labs\"
([LAB1](https://github.com/carluri/nucmed_physics_examples/blob/master/Lab1)
and
[LAB2](https://github.com/carluri/nucmed_physics_examples/blob/master/Lab2))
offered in this course. These are two jupyter-notebook based
assignments, that will get you accustomed to working with medical
(DICOM) images in Python and introduce the relevant Python libraries for
medical image manipulation and analysis. In these assignments, you will
also implement forward and backward projections algorithms and iterative
image reconstruction methods such as the Maximum Likelihood Expectation
Maximization (MLEM) and Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM).
We highly recommend all new students joining our lab (irrespective of
your sub-field of interest) to work through both these assignments, as
these concepts will build a strong foundation and will set the stage for
further exploring the field of medical image analysis.

## Machine learning and Deep learning (Practical approach)

A large part of our research effort is devoted to the development and
application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for
medical image (PET, SPECT, and CT) analyses. Familiarity with python

# Conferences

Another mission of our lab is the effective communication of our
research efforts to the scientific community around the world. An
important part of research activities in Qurit is submission of
abstracts/manuscripts to various conference proceedings. Some of the
relevant conferences where our members have contributed are given below.
The submission deadlines to some of these conferences keep changing each
year. Vist the conference links for the most updated information.

## Word of advice for abstract submissions

Going to a conference is a great opportunity to meet and interact with
other scientists. We should also write abstracts to present our great
ongoing work, and to push ourselves to think outside the box, to
daydream, and to produce results in a timely manner. Meanwhile, it is
likely not a good idea to stop an ongoing important project to get
started on a totally different project in order to have an abstract
submitted for a particular conference. This will prolong the other
project, and will impact the team. What is far more important is to
complete projects assigned to us, so we continue to maintain our
collaborations with colleagues and be able to fulfill our funding
commitments, to be able to support future efforts, and of course to move
towards great discoveries and dissemination of our findings.\
It's best not to ask for conference deadline extensions. It creates
unfavorable habits and reflects poorly on our team. Of course, if a
deadline is provided, you may take it! But you shouldn't count on it.
Some of our projects involve collaborations with other labs and
industry. Those collaborations may involve legal agreements in which we
commit to let our collaborators review material in advance. In some
cases, we even need further approval to be able to submit an abstract.
Due to this, we ask you to provide notice of intent to put in an
abstract based on your work for a conference in advance and not later
than 3 weeks of the submission deadline. Typically, this will come more
naturally as a research effort is developing. We need to be provided
with a written version of the abstract ideally 3 days in advance, and no
later than 24 hours in advance. Keep in mind that when collaborative
research agreements are in place, a written version might be required
even 1 month in advance. Please consult with us if you are not sure by
when is your abstract draft due. If you cannot meet the internal early
deadlines, the abstract cannot likely go in. This is for your own sake,
to have enough time to end up with a great abstract, and so we do not
deprive other authors and collaborators from the courtesy of properly
approving and helping with the write-up.\
When considering publication of an abstract (and especially a journal
paper), please ask yourself the following questions (which the great
Henry Wagner -- the father of nuclear medicine - used to ask): Is what I
am saying clear? Is it true? Is it new? Is it significant? In other
words, you must have clarity, validity, novelty and significance.
Finding the right balance is important. If you feel your work is very
novel, but not overly thorough yet, that might be OK. Writing an
abstract is a great opportunity for you to push and catapult yourself in
new, interesting, exploratory directions under the general area of your
research. At the same time, make sure to discuss well in advance your
ideas for submitting an abstract. We're an abstract-friendly lab! We
like to submit conference abstracts, but we also discuss them months and
weeks in advance. If you're unsure about anything, ask us; talk to us.\

## YouTube channel: Qurit Research & Education

Thanks to the efforts of our excellent PhD student Luke Polson (who is
also a part-time YouTuber), we have managed to set up our lab's YouTube
channel: [*Qurit Research &
Education*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWF6tnHCSXhqXZEker0eXA).
We are currently in the process of uploading the recorded video lectures
of the UBC PHYS 541 Nuclear Medicine course (by Arman and Carlos),
although we plan to have more educational and research contents related
to our lab in the future. Feel free to check out the channel and
subscribe!

## Qurit library

The Qurit library is located in room 1.109 at BCCRI. It is a small
collection of great books on various topics ranging from medical imaging
and nuclear medicine to statistics and dosimetry. You are free to borrow
books to read. We ask that if you take a book home with you, please
return when you're done, since experience shows that in time people may
forget to return books! So please take only 1-2 books at most home with
you, if you're taking anything away from lab space, and please return
books before you pick up another book.

# Miscellaneous

## Some thoughts

Please read these thoughts and words of advice carefully, which we share
with you after having arrived at them after years of observations. Hope
our team can benefit from them!

1.  Aside from leading excellent research, two great qualities you must
    aim for are communication and organization skills. Their value
    should not be underestimated.

2.  Don't make your work your entire life. Have a balanced life. It will
    allow you to be a more all-around human-being, and it can help you
    tremendously at work as well. And yes, work hard and effectively. If
    you're over-worked and exhausted, it likely means you're doing
    something wrong! Push yourself to work hard especially when you
    first arrive to work; easier tasks will find their way later in the
    day! Work effectively during regular working hours, and if you like,
    even more. The key is to be thoughtful and consistent. Please be in
    the lab early enough to allow sufficient interactions during the
    day, unless of course you have coursework or occasional things to
    attend to.

3.  Develop a skill to notice when you're too caught up in a thought or
    effort, and when your thinking has been too narrowed down. Sometimes
    a simple break allows you to refresh, and when back to work, you may
    immediately discover a solution to the problem.

4.  We tend to focus on urgent things and deadlines only. Move beyond
    that. Build good working habits. Important long-term efforts require
    devoted chunks of time, so postpone your less intensive/important
    tasks to later in the day or even week: e.g. replying to trivial
    emails, taking care of typical personal issues, updating something
    on a webpage, etc. If you do more persistent regular research and
    work, you'll be less stressed when deadlines arrive, and as a
    result, you will be less likely to switch to doing distracting
    things to take away stress.

5.  Have a To-do file/document (e.g. Trello) that you constantly update,
    especially at the end of the day/week before you leave. This gives
    you peace, knowing that you've written down pending work, and it
    makes sure you don't forget things.

6.  Feel free to attend to non-work-related material at work. You need
    to be at ease in the lab. It's perfectly fine to keep up socially
    (e.g. on-line) during regular hours. Do find your balance. Try to
    discipline yourself to do the most
    concentrated/challenging/I-don't-feel-like-it/important work
    first-thing in the morning when you arrive, and you'll see that
    other trivial stuff will find their right time and place.

7.  Master the field you're in by extensive reading and discussions. New
    ideas can come to you once you know the field better and you will be
    in a better position to better see the unsolved challenges.
    Especially exchanging ideas with team members or others, in a spirit
    of openness, can bring about considerable creativity.

8.  Prioritize! Otherwise you won't have enough time for anything. Be
    willing to say 'no' to yourself and to others if something is not
    important. This does not mean being selfish. Importance has a wide
    definition. If something is important to someone else, and you can
    contribute to that effort effectively, then it can be important and
    is a priority to be considered.

9.  We want you to be happy, to look forward to being a part of our
    team, and to interact with various members of the team. We want you
    to be successful, and to find your time to be rewarding and
    intellectually appealing. If you have concerns, tell us. It's much
    better than keeping it inside, which can affect your work and
    quality of time in the lab. Good communication can often be an
    amazing tool towards solving problems. And developing great
    communication skills is also key for your interactions with other
    scientists, in our own institution and elsewhere, in conferences,
    etc. People will take you much more seriously, and will consider
    your interests and concerns, if you're able to properly present
    them.

## Take ownership

You are here because we think your character and values is a great match
with our Qurit lab. We want you to grow as a researcher and as an
integral human-being that will be a source of inspiration to many
others. We are here to support you to grow and to help you reach that
next step in your path so that you're better prepared for your future
environments (academia, healthcare, industry, ... and life in general).
To be the best you, you will need to take ownership. In fact, take
extreme ownership of your project and your actions, of yourself! Deep
inside, *you* are your greatest asset. This may not be easy at the
beginning, and you might encounter steep learning curves; but know that
we're here to support you in any way we can as you take front-seat, i.e.
driver's seat, in your research and efforts.\
At the beginning, you will be provided with suggested reading and
research material and resources, but these are only starting points to
help lead you to other interesting and related efforts to follow. As
your project evolves, things will shift and there will be a point in
time where you will become the most knowledgeable person in that topic
in our lab and perhaps in the world. Educate us and share your knowledge
with the rest of us. You will see how rewarding it is to complete your
projects, and remember, you'll be successful if you take extreme
ownership.\

## Vacation

There's a tale of two lumberjacks, John and Bob who worked together.
They would start work at the same time, but John would disappear every
day for about an hour-and-a-half at around lunch time. One day, Bob
asked John how it was possible that he would stay chopping wood
continuously throughout the day while John disappeared and yet John
always chopped more wood than Bob. John's explanation was that he would
disappear for a period of time to sharpen his axe, and that because he
had a sharper axe; he was able to chop more wood in less time.\
You need to sharpen your axe too (body, mind, heart and spirit)!!! You
may do this during a nice vacation in which you get to disconnect from
your everyday life. You can take your vacation when you find it
convenient for you. The only thing that you need to keep in mind is to
not let down the team by doing so. Make sure you notify your direct
mentor and any team members affected with your absence so that
arrangements can be made for the benefit of all.\
If you have questions about the amount of time you are entitled for
vacation, you can find it in your offer letter or in the manual for
students, post-docs or research assistants/associates. If you're unsure,
let us know.\

## Leisure in Vancouver

Are you new to Vancouver? Wondering what to do after your long work day
or during weekends? Well, wonder no more as we have a small list of
activities you can try out during your free time and off-days. Vancouver
is a beautiful city with several opportunities for hiking, biking, and
checking out restaurants. Feel free to explore more (we are not
endorsing any of the links given below).

1.  **Bike around Stanley park**: Rent bikes at Freedom Bike Rentals &
    Repairs <https://www.freedombikes.ca/>. Great prices & people, not
    too busy.

2.  **Canada Place**: Located in the heart of Vancouver's waterfront. An
    iconic landmark to visit, especially during the night time. While
    you are here, it's worth checking out the icecream joint Bella
    Gelateria ("Wickedly Burnt Caramel" is excellent). Gastown and
    Chinatown are also nearby.

3.  **Commodore Lanes**: Excellent place for a weekend getaway with
    friends. The place hosts activities such as 5-pin bowling and
    snooker. <http://www.commodorelanes.com/>

4.  **i-Exit Escape Rooms**: Over here, you get locked in a room and try
    escaping by solving different puzzles and uncovering various hidden
    clues, against a ticking clock. Go with at least 2-3 friends. They
    have student discounts too (if you show your student ID)
    <https://i-exit.com/>.

5.  **Lynn Valley Suspension Bridge (North Vancouver)**: Entry free.
    <https://lynncanyon.ca/>

6.  **Capilano Suspension Bridge (North Vancouver)**: A bit expensive.
    Take a free shuttle from Canada Place
    [https://www.capbridge.com/visit/shuttle-service/
    ](https://www.capbridge.com/visit/shuttle-service/
    ). You can also visit the Grouse Mountain (also expensive) which is
    close to it. It's a good place for ice-skating during the winter
    months (or you can do Grouse Grind walk). North Vancouver's
    Cleveland Dam (free) is also close to it.

7.  **Squamish Gondola**: Expensive BUT VERY beautiful.
    <https://www.seatoskygondola.com/>

8.  **Whistler**: Cite of 2020 Winter Olympics. Excellent place for ski
    lessons.
    <https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/plan-your-trip/ski-and-ride-lessons.aspx>
    (very very expensive but worth a try).

9.  **Car rides and rentals**: Other than using the public
    transportation (bus and skytrain), you can also use Uber or Lyft
    rides (use their app for booking). Or get a car rental from Evo (if
    you have a driver's licence).
